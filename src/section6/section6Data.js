      "They are as useful as all the different types of content they can offer. In fact, in recent years, this type of code is becoming more widely accepted among all kinds of people. It's logical, since with just one scan you can access a great deal of varied information and even facilitate certain tasks such as connecting to a Wi-Fi network.

Nowadays, there are many mobile devices that can read QR codes with the camera itself, by simply pointing the camera at the code to scan it. If this doesn't work, you may need to download an application designed to read QR codes. But don't worry! There are several apps that do just this.",

    content:
      "The biggest difference between the two is that the dynamic QR code can be edited even after being printed, and the static one cannot. Therefore, the dynamic QR code allows us to change both the function and the content at any time and as many times as we want.",
